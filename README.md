Building a Chatbot with RAG Using LangChain &amp; ChromaDB A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot combines retrieval (searching knowledge bases) and generation (LLMs like GPT-4) to provide more accurate and context-aware responses. Below is a detailed architecture and step-by-step implementation for a Chatbot-RAG using LangChain and ChromaDB.
1. Architecture Overview
Main Components
Frontend (Next.js/React)

User uploads PDFs.
User interacts with the chatbot.
Backend (django/with LangChain)

Handles file uploads.
Extracts text, splits it, generates embeddings, and stores them in ChromaDB.
Retrieves relevant document chunks when a user asks a question.
Passes the retrieved chunks to GPT-4 (or another LLM) to generate a final response.
Vector Database (ChromaDB)

Stores document embeddings for efficient retrieval.
LLM (OpenAI GPT-4)

Answers user questions based on retrieved document context.
